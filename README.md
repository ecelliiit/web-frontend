<p align="center">"I'll be back" one of the most favourite dialogue of Arnold Schwarzenegger from the one of the best and aspiried sci-fi movie, "The Terminator". We all have imagined to fight the AI from the techs, one day if they revolted. but though many were being drawn towards its appeal, there were some who instead of dreaming about aliens, thought about creating a bookstore that isn't possible any other way. He worked more than one can think of and today we know him as the CEO of Amazon</p>

<p align="center">We are a bunch of dauntless minds coming from different backgrounds with the aim to DREAM, CREATE and INSPIRE. Our driving moto is "I just live by the ABC's- Adventurous. Brave. Creative", as quoted by Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty in "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty ".
<br>
Our very dream of going on an adventure to meet new people, explore new places, and learn more than we knew the day before lives in our heart rent-free. We, the members of E-Cell IIIT Sonepat, have proudly taken our first step into the arena of analytical and creative hustle, where we shall constantly thrive as our paths lead us to perplex situations. We are all set on this journey of Entrepreneurship.</p>
